# Locked Decisions

- AP is the only workflow
- Embedded UX only
- Human approval is mandatory
- Agent executes, humans decide
- ERP is the system of record
- No payment execution in v1
- No dashboards
- No customization-heavy logic
- Postgres is the production source of truth
- Rejection is terminal for a specific AP item
- Rejection is allowed from needs_approval and approved only if posting has not started
- Resubmission creates a new AP item linked via supersedes metadata
- Slack and Teams are approval channels at launch

These decisions are final.
Changes require founder approval.
